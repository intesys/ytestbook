# yTestbook

## What is yTestbook?

It's a free web application to manage software tests. It's mainly intended for handling manual tests, but it could support automatic tests as well.

# What does it do?

It allows you to define:

- what you want to test (we call it test cases);
- how you expect your software works in different scenarios (tests);
- for each test, you can describe all the steps required to run it.

You can also organize your tests using tags.

Then you can manage test sessions, sunning tests and tracking success and failures, adding comments, assigning tasks and much more.

At any time, you can monitor progress and evaluate problems.

You can look at initial analysis in the [docs folder](./docs/requirements.md).
