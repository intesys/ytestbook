# Roadmap

WIP

yTestbook is currently in design phase, we are working on defining and prioritizine features, using a design-thinking approach.

For sure, we'll deliver an useful set of features to allow user to:

- [ ] define test specs
- [ ] track test execution
- [ ] monitor test status and progress
